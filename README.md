# iFood Marketing Campaign Analysis

This is my first major Data Science and Analytics (DS/DA) project. Here, I explored how data science methods could be applied to a business problem by analyzing a marketing campaign dataset from iFood.

## Objectives
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain actionable business insights.
- Compare a selected-feature model and an all-feature model
- Develop a prediction model to apply to the broader customer base.

## Dataset source
The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from [Github](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test) and pertains to a marketing campaign for iFood. It was originally designed for hiring Data Analysts for the iFood Brain team.

**Reference date:** 28/5/2020 (This date is important because variables such as `Customer_Days` are calculated relative to it.)

## What I Practiced in this Project
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
- Data processing and feature selection
- Building and evaluating a basic machine learning model (logistic regression, implemented in Keras)  
- Interpreting model results in a business context

## Acknowledgement
As this is my first major project in the field, I am aware that there are many areas for improvement. I welcome constructive feedback to help me improve further.
